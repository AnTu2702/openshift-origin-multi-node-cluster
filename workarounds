### Workaround Issue: https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8107

This seems to be a bug in Virtualbox. Still present in latest Windows version at this time; 5.2.8. Error can be reproduced just running the command vboxmanage.exe createdhd --filename foo.vdi --size 10240. If you then delete that .vdi file and run the same command again, you get VERR_ALREADY_EXISTS.

To workaround this, you can run vboxmanage.exe list hdds which will give you a list of virtual hard disks along with their UUIDs, then select the problem disk's UUID and run...

vboxmanage.exe closemedium <UUID> --delete

After doing this you can then create the disk again using the createhd option

### Workaround Issue: ???

The NetworkManager is mandatorily configured for all nodes overwriting /etc/resolv.conf unfortunately with wrong or insufficient nameserver entries.
As a preliminary workaround, modify the following file on toolbox.local.net before executing the config.yml main playbook for Openshift!
- Open the file:
/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_node_dnsmasq/files/networkmanager/99-origin-dns.sh
- Add this line before line 116:
echo "nameserver 192.168.1.100 >> ${NEW_RESOLV_CONF}"
